Thank you for your attention. The relevant code for CEFusion is provided here. Since the paper is under review and some parts of the code are needed for other applications, only the initial version of the code has been made public, and some of the structural code has been retained.

The overall architecture of the initial code remains the same as the final version, with some structural replacements, and we still provide test models for the initial version.

The model can be download at the link:https://pan.baidu.com/s/1fzwU4HiL70ULLEZPRTyhwA
