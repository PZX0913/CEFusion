Thank you for your attention. The relevant code for CEFusion is provided here. Since the paper is under review and some parts of the code are needed for other applications, Only part of the code has been published and part of the structure has been retained.

The overall architecture of the code remains the same as the final version, with some structural replacements, and we still provide test models for this version.

The model can be download at the link:https://pan.baidu.com/s/1fzwU4HiL70ULLEZPRTyhwA
