Thank you for your attention. The relevant code for CEFusion (an infrared and visible image fusion network) is provided here. Since the paper is under review and some parts of the code are needed for other applications, only part of the code has been published and part of the structure has been retained. After the acceptance of the paper, we will make the remaining part of the code public, thank you for your understanding.

The overall architecture of the code remains the same as the final version, with some structural replacements, and we still provide a test models for this version.

The model can be download at the link:https://pan.baidu.com/s/1fzwU4HiL70ULLEZPRTyhwA. 
Code:0913
The test dataset can be download at the link:https://pan.baidu.com/s/1ZJXz9ILqUvBgQTJHPOWmzQ.
Code:0816

Before testing, please modify the path of the input image in the TaskFusion_dataset.py.
